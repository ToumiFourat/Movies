## üéûÔ∏è Trailer Upload Flow

The trailer upload process in this project follows a multi-step architecture between the frontend, backend, cloud storage, and database. The full flow is illustrated below:

![Trailer Upload Flow](./flow.png)

**Steps Overview:**

1. **Frontend (React)** sends the trailer file via `FormData` to the **Backend API (Node/Express)**.
2. The backend uploads the trailer to **Cloudinary** (cloud storage).
3. Cloudinary returns a **video URL**.
4. The backend sends this URL back to the frontend.
5. The frontend then sends a final request with metadata and video URL.
6. The backend saves the movie data in **MongoDB**.
